   ## 3. Personal Document Storage

   Upon logging in, you will be redirected to the **Dashboard / Personal View**.

   - Here you can view a library of all documents you own.
   - You can easily filter documents by their current statuses: **Draft**, **In Approval**, **Approved**, or **Rejected**.

   ## 4. Working with Documents

   ### 4.1 Creating and Importing

   - **Create:** Click the button to create a new document. A blank canvas will open in the editor.
   - **Import DOCX:** Use the Import view to upload an existing Microsoft Word `.docx` file. Our Python backend will parse the file and preserve its structure and content inside the web editor.

   The system utilizes a powerful built-in rich text editor (Tiptap). Your changes are saved automatically.

   - **Typography & Style:** Font sizes, bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough.
   - **Structure:** Multi-level headings, bulleted lists, and numbered lists.
   - **Formatting:** Text alignment, line spacing, text color, and background highlighting.
   - **Page Settings:** You can adjust formatting options seamlessly within the editor view.

   ### 4.3 Exporting Documents

   At any time, document owners or users with read access can export the document.

   - Click the **Export** button in the editor.

   - Choose between **PDF** (generated via backend PDF tools) or **DOCX** format.

   - The file will automatically download to your local device.

   As a document owner, you can share your draft with colleagues to collaborate before the official approval.

   1. Open the document and click **Share**.
   2. A dialog box will appear. Select enterprise users and assign permissions: **View**, **Comment**, or **Edit**.

   ### 5.2 Real-Time Collaboration

   - When multiple users with "Edit" access open the document, the system connects via WebSockets.
   - You will see colored cursors identifying where your colleagues are currently typing.
   - Changes appear on your screen in real-time.

   ### 5.3 Commenting

   2. Add a comment explaining your suggestion or question.

   3. Other users can reply to your comment, creating a discussion thread.

   ## 6. The Approval Process

   ### 6.1 Launching an Approval

   When your draft is finalized, you can send it for official approval.

   2. Select the required managers/approvers from the enterprise list.

   3. Choose the Approval Type:

      - **Strict Order:** Approvers must review the document sequentially.

   4. The document status will update to **In Approval**.

   ### 6.2 Inbox (For Approvers)

   If you are assigned to approve a document, you will find it in your **Inbox View**.

   1. Open the document to review the content and any unresolved comments.

   2. Click **Approve** or **Reject**.

   3. *If Rejecting:* You must enter a reason for refusal. This is saved to the approval history. The document will change to **Rejected** status and editing will be locked.

   ## 7. Versioning and Diff Comparison

   If a document is rejected, the owner must create a new version to address the manager's feedback.

   1. The author edits the document, creating a new iteration.

   2. The author re-launches the approval process.

   3. When managers review the updated document, they can open the **Diff View** (Compare Versions).

   4. The system automatically compares the old text with the new text. It visually highlights **added text (green)** and **deleted text (red)**, making it exceptionally easy to verify what changes were made.

   5. Once all approvers accept the changes, the document is marked as **Approved** and becomes part of the permanent corporate library.
